* Running changelog
** [2022-01-31 Mon 15:28]: fixed instance generation bug (cavemen) 
** [2022-01-24 Mon 12:14]: generated 'long' problems 
See [[mu4e:msgid:871r127c2f.fsf@g.clemson.edu][Re: Two ideas]] for details

* Rev1 as submitted
** [2021-04-05 Mon 16:57]: generated degree-2, -3, and -4 instances.  
   Interestingly, still width-4 cover DD.
** [2021-04-02 Fri 16:45]: found a subtle bug in =ColorSorter= 
   Infinite loop occurs with:
   f_color= [2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 0, 2, 5, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7, 6, 3]
   target=[ 1, 10, 11, 12, 14,  5,  7,  4,  8,  2, 15,  9,  3, 13,  6]
** [2021-04-02 Fri 15:13]: implemented ColorSorter 
** [2021-04-01 Thu 12:36]: switched to =networkx= for random graph generation 
** [2021-03-31 Wed 18:56]: implemented color+overlap DDs, simple cross-check passing
** [2021-03-29 Mon 20:13]: revised =BDD.rename_vars= (to respect partial updates) 
** [2021-03-19 Fri 13:48]: implemented a cUFL MIP 
   seems like a simple program, though -- let's see if we'll have an edge with BDDs...
** [2021-03-08 Mon 16:50]: drafted the BDD representation for 'colorful' UFL. 
** [2021-03-05 Fri 13:20]: refactored =dia_sizes.sh= into a separate experiment 
** [2021-03-05 Fri 12:34]: implemented x-only NF model. 
** [2021-02-22 Mon 17:42]: implemented =swap_up= for weighted DDs 
   (simple tests passsing)
** [2021-02-22 Mon 12:30]: drafted =swap_up= for a weighted BDD
** [2021-02-22 Mon 12:29]: drafted =truth_table= for a weighted BDD
** [2021-02-19 Fri 16:21]: drafted the implementation of =intersect= 
** [2021-02-19 Fri 13:16]: implemented availability, covering BDDs + naive MIPs (tests passing)
** [2021-02-18 Thu 14:40]: implemented MIP generation (for arbitrary g, dict) 
** [2021-02-18 Thu 13:51]: removed $x_i$ variables
   (following the recommendation of JCS: indeed, these are unnecessary to encode
   the decision, if I have $z_{ij}$.
** [2021-02-16 Tue 14:03]: removed hard "cover all" constraint (covering DD generation)
** [2021-02-16 Tue 11:57]: dealt with linting (=flake8=) for =UFL.py=
** [2021-02-13 Sat 13:29]: creating (weighted) covering BDD with arbitrary overlap penalties
** [2021-02-13 Sat 13:04]: implemented (unweighted) covering BDD for arbitrary g(Â·) 
** [2021-02-12 Fri 21:58]: implemented weighted BDD generation for UFL (no overlap penalty)
** [2021-02-12 Fri 16:41]: added weights to BDD class
** [2021-02-12 Fri 16:04]: tested BDD 2 MIP with a pair of (unweighted) BDDs (passed)
 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/testing/BDD2MIP_1.org::*From diagram $A$:][From diagram $A$:]]
** [2021-02-12 Fri 14:07]: incorporated binary 'linking' variables 
** [2021-02-12 Fri 12:57]: added a simple BDD to MIP function (no weights)
