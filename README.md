# On Aligning Non-Order-Associated Binary Decision Diagrams.

This repository contains implementation details and experimental set up
for paper "On Aligning Non-Order-Associated Binary Decision Diagrams"
by Bochkarev and Smith (preprint is available
via [Optimization-Online](https://optimization-online.org/?p=19666)).

These materials include the source code (see python files in `experiments` and the
root folder), results of the computational experiments (in `run_logs`),
and the raw instances data (in `instances`). The computational set up
is built around the main [makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile),
which contains [all the recipes](./Makefile) necessary to run the
experiments and build the figures from the paper.

Full code documentation, including instance data format descriptions, code
organization along with further details is hosted on the authors'
[website](https://www.bochkarev.io/research/align-BDD/code-docs/overview.html).
Local copy of the documentation is stored in this repository in
[docs](./docs/build/html/overview.html).
