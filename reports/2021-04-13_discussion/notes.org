* Node picking algorithm: min-degree is (kind of) best
** Max degree instead of min degree
   No of cases where =max= is better than =min=: 138 out of 1000

** Random node instead of min degree
   No of cases where =rnd= is better than =min=: 78 out of 1000

* Pre-ordering effect (on the intersection DD size): kind of okay
  No of cases where preorder made sense: *358* out of *500*

* Quick-note: BDD-tailored SP algo
  Single (backward) pass through the intersection DD.
  
* Runtimes: SP-solve is fast, indeed.

* Intersection diagram sizes: =gsifts= is good, but slow.
