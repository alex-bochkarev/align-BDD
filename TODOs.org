#+TITLE: Align-BDD project
#+CATEGORY: a-BDD
#+STARTUP: show2levels

* Immediate TODOs
  - [X] 1: soft cover constraints (general type) -- see the revision notes
  - [X] idea 2a (cross-terms, x1x2, etc.)
  - [ ] idea 2b (function of cross-terms) -- ?
  - [X] =build_cover_DD=: make single overlap version
  - [X] =build_color_DD=: fix the procedure (linear DD growth is doable!)
  - [X] =build_tUFLP_MIP=: revise to single overlap version
  - [X] cross-check DDs with the MIP (simple)
  - [X] fix the bug in cover DD generation (infinite loop?..)
  - [X] cross-check DDs with the MIP (random set)
  - [X] test the align-BDD version.
  - [X] implement color ordering / fix the color-DD order
  - [X] test the new problem (against Gurobi) -- runtimes.
  - [X] special case instance (string): diagram sizes
  - [X] special case (organic thing): dia sizes. Is it max degree?
  - [X] example of 'arbitrarily poor' heuristic.
  - [X] randomized cover-DD builder (random order of nodes)
  - [X] randomized color-DD builder
  - [X] num test
  - [X] Look into =gen_test_p.csv= (dia sizes for various instance gen parameters =p=)
  - [X] check out =gen_test_colors.csv= (different no. of colors for given =n = 15=
  - [ ] check out if the costs are correct for =build_color_DD=.
    I thought it was not assume to include costs at all. How does it pass the tests?..
  - [ ] maybe generate t-UFLP differently?
    distribute the first facility into every bin, and then sort them randomly?
