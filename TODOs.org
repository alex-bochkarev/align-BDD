* Immediate TODOs
  - [X] =build_cover_DD=: make single overlap version
  - [X] =build_color_DD=: fix the procedure (linear DD growth is doable!)
  - [X] =build_cUFL_MIP=: revise to single overlap version
  - [X] cross-check DDs with the MIP (simple)
  - [X] fix the bug in cover DD generation (infinite loop?..)
  - [X] cross-check DDs with the MIP (random set)
  - [X] test the align-BDD version.
  - [ ] implement color ordering / fix the color-DD order
  - [ ] test the new problem (against Gurobi) -- runtimes.
  - [ ] write-up

As of beginning of the day <2020-07-11> all of these are merged into =master=

 [2021-02-19 Fri 12:47]
** TODO add diagram generation tests :UFL:
** TODO Structure the code into a package + submodules
** TODO Maybe look into Sphinx?.. Or what is the best practice? :doc:

** TODO implement =BDD.save()= for a weighted BDD
 [2021-02-22 Mon 12:29]
** TODO Perhaps, =is_equivalent= is a bad name?
 [2021-02-22 Mon 13:48]
 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/BDD.py]]

 Like, maybe rename to =test_equivalence=. And then =is_equivalent <- test_equivalence()[0]=
** TODO rename =VarSeq.layer_var= into =vars=, I suppose...
 [2021-02-22 Mon 17:52]
** DONE Move =are_equivalent= method to =BDD.py=

 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/experiments/BDD_size_illustration/BDD_size_illustration.py::B.load("./sample_5var_inst.bdd")]]
** TODO let S NOT contain the node itself -- amended later :cUFL:
 [2021-03-22 Mon 18:34]
