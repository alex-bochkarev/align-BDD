* Immediate TODOs
  - [ ] 1: soft cover constraints (general type) -- see the revision notes
  - [ ] idea 2a (cross-terms, x1x2, etc.)
  - [ ] idea 2b (function of cross-terms) -- ?
  - [X] =build_cover_DD=: make single overlap version
  - [X] =build_color_DD=: fix the procedure (linear DD growth is doable!)
  - [X] =build_tUFLP_MIP=: revise to single overlap version
  - [X] cross-check DDs with the MIP (simple)
  - [X] fix the bug in cover DD generation (infinite loop?..)
  - [X] cross-check DDs with the MIP (random set)
  - [X] test the align-BDD version.
  - [X] implement color ordering / fix the color-DD order
  - [X] test the new problem (against Gurobi) -- runtimes.
  - [X] special case instance (string): diagram sizes
  - [X] special case (organic thing): dia sizes. Is it max degree?
  - [X] example of 'arbitrarily poor' heuristic.
  - [X] randomized cover-DD builder (random order of nodes)
  - [X] randomized color-DD builder
  - [X] num test
  - [X] Look into =gen_test_p.csv= (dia sizes for various instance gen parameters =p=)
  - [X] check out =gen_test_colors.csv= (different no. of colors for given =n = 15=
  - [ ] check out if the costs are correct for =build_color_DD=.
    I thought it was not assume to include costs at all. How does it pass the tests?..
  - [ ] maybe generate t-UFLP differently?
    distribute the first facility into every bin, and then sort them randomly?

It seems getting slow for already N=42 points...

  OK, seems slow for N=500 vars, M=500 terms and Jmax = 25 vars per term max
  (my single experiment took )

** TODO Kill already merged branches
 [2020-07-11 Sat 09:49]

- minor_fixes (figures, labels, etc.)
- scal_update (major scal update)

As of beginning of the day <2020-07-11> all of these are merged into =master=
** TODO Clean-up testing code (remove unnecessary, add separate testing)
 [2021-02-19 Fri 12:47]
** TODO add diagram generation tests :UFL:
** TODO Revise tests for key functions
** TODO Requires =gurobi= to run examples :doc:

** TODO implement =BDD.save()= for a weighted BDD
 [2021-02-22 Mon 12:29]
** TODO Perhaps, =is_equivalent= is a bad name?
 [2021-02-22 Mon 13:48]
 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/BDD.py]]

 Like, maybe rename to =test_equivalence=. And then =is_equivalent <- test_equivalence()[0]=
** TODO rename =VarSeq.layer_var= into =vars=, I suppose...
 [2021-02-22 Mon 17:52]
** TODO rename =cUFL= (streamlining names)
** TODO let S NOT contain the node itself -- amended later :cUFL:
 [2021-03-22 Mon 18:34]
** TODO figure (1) the order of colors and (2) order of nodes within a color
 [2021-03-30 Tue 13:32]
** TODO Technical description :doc:
   - makefile
   - pytest and testing framework
** TODO maybe instances gallery for tUFL?

** DONE Introduce a proper testing framework
