* Immediate TODOs
  - [X] =build_cover_DD=: make single overlap version
  - [X] =build_color_DD=: fix the procedure (linear DD growth is doable!)
  - [X] =build_cUFL_MIP=: revise to single overlap version
  - [X] cross-check DDs with the MIP (simple)
  - [X] fix the bug in cover DD generation (infinite loop?..)
  - [X] cross-check DDs with the MIP (random set)
  - [X] test the align-BDD version.
  - [X] implement color ordering / fix the color-DD order
  - [X] test the new problem (against Gurobi) -- runtimes.
  - [X] special case instance (string): diagram sizes
  - [X] special case (organic thing): dia sizes. Is it max degree?
  - [X] example of 'arbitrarily poor' heuristic.
  - [X] randomized cover-DD builder (random order of nodes)
  - [X] randomized color-DD builder
  - [ ] num tests

* Current project TODOs
** TODO Kill already merged branches
 [2020-07-11 Sat 09:49]

- minor_fixes (figures, labels, etc.)
- scal_update (major scal update)

As of beginning of the day <2020-07-11> all of these are merged into =master=
** TODO Introduce a proper testing framework
** TODO Clean-up testing code (remove unnecessary, add separate testing)
 [2021-02-19 Fri 12:47]
** TODO add diagram generation tests :UFL:
** TODO Structure the code into a package + submodules
** TODO Maybe look into Sphinx?.. Or what is the best practice? :doc:
** TODO Revise tests for key functions
** TODO Requires =gurobi= to run examples :doc:

 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/UFL.py][file:~/projects/align-BDD/UFL.py]]
** TODO implement =BDD.save()= for a weighted BDD
 [2021-02-22 Mon 12:29]
** TODO Perhaps, =is_equivalent= is a bad name?
 [2021-02-22 Mon 13:48]
 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/BDD.py]]

 Like, maybe rename to =test_equivalence=. And then =is_equivalent <- test_equivalence()[0]=
** TODO rename =VarSeq.layer_var= into =vars=, I suppose...
 [2021-02-22 Mon 17:52]
** TODO rename =cUFL= (streamlining names)
** DONE Move =are_equivalent= method to =BDD.py=
   CLOSED: [2020-08-13 Thu 11:14]

 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/experiments/BDD_size_illustration/BDD_size_illustration.py::B.load("./sample_5var_inst.bdd")]]
** TODO let S NOT contain the node itself -- amended later :cUFL:
 [2021-03-22 Mon 18:34]
** TODO figure (1) the order of colors and (2) order of nodes within a color
 [2021-03-30 Tue 13:32]
** TODO Technical description :doc:
   - makefile
   - pytest and testing framework
** TODO maybe instances gallery for tUFL?
