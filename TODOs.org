* Immediate TODOs
  - [X] fix weights at zero arcs (they were wrong, I suppose)
  - [X] remove hard constraint on "cover everyone"
  - [X] remove c_ij weights from /problem generation/
  - [X] remove $x_i$ variables at all (for /availability/ BDD)
  - [ ] build a naive-MIP (for arbitrary g)
  - [ ] compare naive-MIP and BDD-MIP (solutions must coincide)
  - [ ] think about reduction procedure by cite:hooker2013 (would it ever work?)
  - [ ] build intersection BDDs out of two
  - [ ] build NF from the intersection BDD
  - [X] implement MIP formulation from BDDs : FIXME: won't work with weighted BDDs! (trivial changes needed)
  - [X] make arbitrary-g BDDs (expanding covering DDs)
