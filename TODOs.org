* Immediate TODOs
  - [X] fix weights at zero arcs (they were wrong, I suppose)
  - [X] remove hard constraint on "cover everyone"
  - [X] remove c_ij weights from /problem generation/
  - [X] remove $x_i$ variables at all (for /availability/ BDD)
  - [X] build a naive-MIP (for arbitrary g)
  - [X] compare naive-MIP and BDD-MIP (solutions must coincide)
  - [X] build intersection BDDs out of two
  - [X] modify =swap_up= to account for edge costs!
  - [X] build NF from the intersection BDD
  - [X] think about reduction procedure by cite:hooker2013 (would it ever work?)
  - [X] implement MIP formulation from BDDs : FIXME: won't work with weighted BDDs! (trivial changes needed)
  - [X] make arbitrary-g BDDs (expanding covering DDs)
 
* Current project TODOs
** TODO Kill already merged branches
 [2020-07-11 Sat 09:49]
 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/BDD.py][file:~/projects/align-BDD/BDD.py]]

- minor_fixes (figures, labels, etc.)
- scal_update (major scal update)

As of beginning of the day <2020-07-11> all of these are merged into =master=
** TODO Revise tests for key functions
** TODO add diagram generation tests :UFL:
** DONE Move =are_equivalent= method to =BDD.py=
   CLOSED: [2020-08-13 Thu 11:14]
 [2020-08-12 Wed 12:07]
 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/experiments/BDD_size_illustration/BDD_size_illustration.py::B.load("./sample_5var_inst.bdd")]]
** TODO Requires =gurobi= to run examples :doc:
 [2021-02-06 Sat 17:40]
 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/UFL.py][file:~/projects/align-BDD/UFL.py]]
** TODO Maybe look into Sphinx?.. Or what is the best practice? :doc:
** TODO Structure the code into a package + submodules
** TODO Clean-up testing code (remove unnecessary, add separate testing)
 [2021-02-19 Fri 12:47]
** TODO implement =BDD.save()= for a weighted BDD
 [2021-02-22 Mon 12:29]
** TODO Perhaps, =is_equivalent= is a bad name?
 [2021-02-22 Mon 13:48]
 [[file:~/projects/align-BDD/BDD.py]]

 Like, maybe rename to =test_equivalence=. And then =is_equivalent <- test_equivalence()[0]=
** TODO rename =VarSeq.layer_var= into =vars=, I suppose...
